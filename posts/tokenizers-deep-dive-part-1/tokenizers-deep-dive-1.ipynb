    "In the conclusion of my <a href=\"../tokenizer-problems/tokenizer-problems.html\" target=\"_blank\">recent blog post</a> I argued that I disagree with Andrej Karpathy's claims about the current state of tokenizer availability and tooling. In particular:\n",
    "\n",
    "- I do not agree that there are no good alternatives to OpenAI's GPT-4 tokenizer and their `tiktoken` library, especially since the <a href=\"https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3/\" target=\"_blank\">release of Llama 3</a>.\n",
    "- Also, it is not the case that there are no good tools to train tokenizers from scratch fast, as the `tokenizers` library from Hugging Face has the functionality for both training and running tokenizers in inference mode. It is built in Rust, so it is extremely fast, and has reasonably approachable documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This prompted me to do a deep dive into tokenizers and how one would go about building one from scratch. Inspired by the <a href=\"https://www.fast.ai/posts/2016-10-08-teaching-philosophy.html#good-education-starts-with-the-whole-game\" target=\"_blank\">top-down approach</a> from Jeremy Howard, whose courses I enjoy a lot, this blog post will start with the very basics of tokenizers and then focus on how to train a Llama 3-like tokenizer on your own data with as little code as possible. Finally, we will explore what influence different proportions of English/non-English/code data have on the final vocabulary learnt by the tokenizer, as well as discuss a paper on how tokenizer design choices impact the downstream performance of the LLM.\n",

    "I am mostly assuming that if you found and opened this article, you have at least a basic understanding of what tokenization is and what its purpose is, but let's do a quick revision just to make sure we are all on the same page.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do we need tokenization in the first place?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Majority of machine learning models operate on numbers, and (large) language models are no exception.\n",
    "2. Whether it is natural language, code, or something else, we want to be able to input strings into the language models.\n",
    "3. This is where tokenization comes in, it is a **process of converting strings of text into numbers** that can then be fed into language models.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{.callout-note}\n",
    "This last point is actually the reason why the current state-of-the-art language models are not actually end-to-end systems.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "**How do tokenizers work on a high level?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, the long input string is split into smaller chunks called *tokens*.\n",
    "1. Then, a *vocabulary*, which is a mapping from known tokens to integers, is used to convert the tokens to integer ids.\n",
    "1. These ids can be fed as input into language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are some qualities that we want our tokenizers to have?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We want our tokenizers to be able to process various kinds of inputs. In this article, we will not be able to fully dig into the various design choices made when building tokenizers to achieve this, but here is a (likely non-exhaustive) list of qualities that we want the tokenizers to have:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. They should work on both English and non-English texts, both uppercase and lowercase, both Latin and non-Latin alphabet.\n",
    "1. They should be able to handle various kinds of special characters that we might find in the wild, such as emojis ðŸ¤—.\n",
    "1. They should be able to handle code.\n",
    "1. (Optional) They should be able to tokenize unseen words without the need to include a special `<unk>` token in their vocabulary."

    "1. **Model**: an algorithm that performs the tokenization (i.e. takes strings, splits them an converts into tokens).\n",
