    "`<|endoftext|>` is a special tokens which hints LLMs that they should stop generating text, so if you accidentally put that into the model, it might halt abruptly. Simple string processing techniques can help deal with such edge cases most of the time, though that sometimes leads to undesired behaviours, such as the one below which likely happens because OpenAI's tokenizers remove special tokens from the input string during pre-processing:\n",

    "We can see that in the first image, the trailing space becomes a separate token. However, the tokenizers often concatenate words the the spaces before them, just like the for word ` once` in the second image. Since models are trained to predict the next token, during training the learn to predict the token ` once` from the tokens that go before it up to the colon `:`, so the case where they have to predict the token `once` following a space `' '` is completely out of distrubution for them and can lead to all kinds of peculiar behaviours.\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, the tokenization process of the language modelling pipeline should not be neglected and can lead to poor LLMs performance, undesired behaviours or even safety issues. However, I would like to challenge a few of Andrej Karpathy's statements from the conclusion of the video. In particular:\n",
    "\n",
    "- He suggested using OpenAI's `tiktoken` library and use the `GPT-4` tokenizer. While this is true, I believe that there are also a lot of great tokenizers in the open-source realm, e.g. the new <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B\" target=\"_blank\">`LLaMA 3`</a> tokenizer seems to take most of the consideration from this post into account.\n",
    "- If one would like to train their own tokenizer, Andrej suggested using BPE with sentencepiece from Google. However, I think this neglects the amazing work by the Hugging Face team on their `tokenizers` library. It has functionality to both train tokenizers and run them in inference mode, it is super fast because it is written in Rust, and the documentation is also rather approachable in my opinion. In fact, I plan to do a deep dive on tokenization using this library where the end goal would be to replicate the `LLaMA 3` tokenizer as closely as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quick footnote:** in his video on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-SPH9hIKT8\" target=\"_blank\">on building LLMs in 2024</a>, Thomas Wolf video suggests that things are not as hopeless as they might seem and argues that as long as we are reasonably thoughtful about the tokenization process, the problems above can be avoided for the most part. He also adds that one should not spend too much time on this step of building a language model as it is not something that can bring one to building AGI 😅."
