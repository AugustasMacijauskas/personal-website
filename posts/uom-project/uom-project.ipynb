    "\n",
    "The idea is simple - using numerical methods to approximate solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations. The particular setup that I used was not too interesting and was chosen because it is a good toy example, you can find all of the details are in the PDF linked above. Here I will present only the main ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compare different approaches to solve the problem: **time-stepping methods** versus finding the steady-state solution by using **Newton-Raphson iteration**.\n",
    "1. Compare different implementations of the methods and their running speeds and memory usage.\n",
    "1. Learn more about optimization and scientific computing and, most important of all, have fun!"

    "## Opportunities for growth\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, I had many opportunities to strengthen my understanding of optimization and scientific computing. In particular, I:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learnt about various (non)linear optimization methods: least- quares, Newton-Raphson iteration, Gauss-Newton method, LBFGS, etc.\n",
    "1. Learnt how these methods can be used through various Python packages (`SciPy`, `PyTorch`, but also `JAX` which I found to be amazing, expect more projects built on `JAX` in the future!).\n",
    "1. Compared the performance of the various methods using the different implementations.\n",
    "1. Also learnt the basic of `nbdev` and really enjoyed using it, for example, it made testing and publishing the code extremely easy (just for fun, I put up <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/uom-project/\" target=\"_blank\">the code on PyPI</a>)."

    "## Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find many more findings in the linked PDF, but the most interesting findings to me seem to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Newton-Raphson iteration is much faster than time-stepping methods (although that is only true in this particular case - it is not always possible to apply this method).\n",
    "1. As can be seen in <a href=\"https://github.com/AugustasMacijauskas/uom-project\" target=\"_blank\">this notebook</a>, `PyTorch` and `JAX` perform faster both on CPU and GPU, but that's probably expected.\n",
    "1. On a GPU, `PyTorch` and `JAX` perform mostly the same. I expected `JAX` to be faster due to the fact that it uses jitting, but maybe the scale of the problem was not large enough to see a real difference (might be an interesting direction for future work)."

    "\n",
    "I feel content with the project for now, but here is a (inexhaustive) list of things that could be improved:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The current solvers are specific (the specifics of the problem are hard-coded into them). It might be worth abstracting the parts that define the problem into a separate entity and make the solvers operate on that entity.\n",
    "1. There is a lot of code that was written in a rush, so it is not always as elegant as it could be.\n",
    "1. More tests could be added."
