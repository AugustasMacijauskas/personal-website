I am a recent BSc Mathematics graduate.

In my free time I lead a self-directed learning journey, mostly focusing on machine learning and science.

I am open for job opportunities and collaborations.

Let's have a chat on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/augustas-macijauskas/). You can also check my work on my [Github](https://github.com/AugustasMacijauskas).
